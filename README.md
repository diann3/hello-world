# hello-world

Hi People!

This is Dianne. I'm a kitchen addict! I've been in the profession for more than 10 years! I'm sharing my vast knowledge and experience on a blog. 
I'm also interested in the software world and want to create my own site from scratch via building a program from the bottom up by using programing languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
